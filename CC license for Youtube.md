# CC licenses and YouTube

In this article I would like to discuss CC licenses and their limitations when spreading the Dhamma on YouTube.

There are seven licenses that an author can apply on his/her work.

[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

[CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) <br><br>

[CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)<br><br>

### CC0 1.0 Universal

The CC0 license is the most liberal license and, in my opinion, the best license for Dhamma spreading purposes. This is the license that Ajahn Sujato recommends for publishing buddhist scriptures in [his article Copy this!](https://sujato.wordpress.com/2015/05/20/copy-this/)<br><br>

A great part of the texts on Sutta Central have been published under CC0. 

However, using the CC0 license means that the author completaly gives up his copyright. Unfortuantely this is not possible in the Czech Republic and, therefore, the CC experts in the Czech Republic recommend using the second most liberal license instead: the CC BY 4.0 license.<br><br>

### ND condition

Two of the licenses have the ND condition included.

CC BY-ND
